\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this assignment, we have proposed an AADL model to describe a smart fire alarm system, containing sensors, communication infrastructure and other devices. This model provides basis for latency analysis, which is crucial in emergency services. Additionally, the model served as basis for a code generation template, which allowed the creation of a simple web page.

Extensions to this project could follow one of these routes: further specification of hardware properties of the devices, in order to analyze hardware requirements for the system; complete specification of the network layer, including reasonably accurate bandwidth restrictions and requirements, in order to identify possible bottlenecks; or use the model as basis to a simulation that generates randomized sensor data and checks that the remainder of the system behaves appropriately.
